== Selector Test #1

Playing with a firebug/xray style interface that is generated from the backend. This will be useful because it can strip out scripts to prevent
conflicts. It will also allow you to have scripts trigger events outside of the frame, because it works as a proxy.

I'm sorry it is not better documented. This was just a quick test.
